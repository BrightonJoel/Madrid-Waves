        <ul>
          <li>
            The objective of the project is to create a blogging web app called
            Madrid Waves for all Madridistaâ€™s around the world
          </li>
          <li>Built with latest tech stack</li>
          <li>
            In short users can like, comment, share and create blog articles
            with ease
          </li>
          <li>
            Our motive is to make it minimalistic and to give the user a
            seamless experience across all devices
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          What I feel about being a madridista is being your very best. Being
          the best of the best in all possible moments. Triving for success and
          discipline. Being great as a person, being nice and polite to everyone
          and achieving your objectives and working hard for it that's my view
          of being Royal and pure. Dressing up clean white represents a person
          who takes care of herself and has their life together. I myself am
          working for this and I'm improving myself greatly and Real Madrid has
          honestly helped me a lot. I still have much work to do before I have
          my life together but I know I'm on the correct path.
